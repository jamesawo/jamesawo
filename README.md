# Hi 👋🏾 I'm James

I'm a full-stack software engineer focused on backend development. My skills encompass Java, Kotlin, Python, Typescript,
Javascript, the MERN stack, and a range of other tools. This expertise enables me to develop solutions that seamlessly
connect technology with business requirements. In addition to coding, I hold a profound interest in business
development, which significantly enriches my problem-solving approach.

In my journey, I've had the privilege to develop specialized software solutions for businesses in my community. These
solutions span across different industries, including healthcare, education, inventory, e-payments, management tools,
etc. You can explore these projects in my [repositories](https://github.com/jamesawo?tab=repositories) and check
[projects on my website](https://jamesaworo.com/projects) for how-to-use documentation.

Collaboration is something I truly value, and being part of a team knowing that the software I build is helping others by
solving their problems gives me a great sense of satisfaction.
